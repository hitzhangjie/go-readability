--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`go-readability` forked from `golangci-lint`, it is used to calculate the score of go code readability. It runs linters
defined in `yaml` (or using zero configuration) in parallel to find the issues that do harm to go code readability, then
we calculate the readability score by serveral formulas.

## Install `go-readability`

run `go get -u github.com/hitzhangjie/go-readability`
